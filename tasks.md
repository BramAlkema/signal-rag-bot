# Production Readiness Tasks

Based on SPECIFICATIONS.md and SECURITY.md, these tasks will make the Signal RAG bot secure, robust, testable, and production-ready.

## Tasks

- [x] 1. Implement Security Controls & Input Validation
  - [x] 1.1 Write tests for input sanitization and rate limiting
  - [x] 1.2 Implement input sanitization function (max length, character validation, injection prevention)
  - [x] 1.3 Implement rate limiter class (10 msg/min, 100 msg/hour per user)
  - [x] 1.4 Add secrets manager for environment variable validation
  - [x] 1.5 Implement prompt hardening to prevent injection attacks
  - [x] 1.6 Add suspicious pattern detection (threat detector)
  - [x] 1.7 Integrate all security controls into signal_bot_rag.py
  - [x] 1.8 Verify all security tests pass

- [x] 2. Implement Robust Error Handling & Recovery
  - [x] 2.1 Write tests for error scenarios (signal-cli timeout, OpenAI errors, FAISS corruption)
  - [x] 2.2 Add retry logic with exponential backoff for API calls
  - [x] 2.3 Implement circuit breaker for OpenAI API failures
  - [x] 2.4 Add graceful degradation for RAG failures (fallback responses)
  - [x] 2.5 Implement signal-cli auto-reconnect on timeout
  - [x] 2.6 Add FAISS index validation and integrity checks
  - [x] 2.7 Add comprehensive error logging with sanitized messages
  - [x] 2.8 Verify all error handling tests pass

- [x] 3. Add Monitoring, Logging & Audit Trail
  - [x] 3.1 Write tests for audit logging and metrics collection
  - [x] 3.2 Implement structured JSON logging with log rotation
  - [x] 3.3 Add audit logger (hash user IDs, redact sensitive data)
  - [x] 3.4 Implement anomaly detector (message length, off-hours usage)
  - [x] 3.5 Add metrics collection (messages, response time, errors)
  - [x] 3.6 Create health check endpoint/function
  - [x] 3.7 Add alerting for critical errors (API key invalid, quota exceeded)
  - [x] 3.8 Verify all monitoring tests pass

- [x] 4. Create Comprehensive Test Suite
  - [x] 4.1 Set up pytest configuration and fixtures
  - [x] 4.2 Write unit tests for custom_rag.py (chunking, embedding, search) - target 90% coverage
  - [x] 4.3 Write unit tests for signal_bot_rag.py (message handling, auth, commands) - target 80% coverage
  - [x] 4.4 Write integration tests for end-to-end message flow (activation, query, response)
  - [x] 4.5 Write performance tests (response time, concurrent users, memory usage)
  - [x] 4.6 Write security tests (injection attacks, rate limiting, authorization bypass)
  - [x] 4.7 Add code coverage reporting and CI/CD integration
  - [x] 4.8 Verify all tests pass with >80% overall coverage

- [ ] 5. Build Production-Ready Docker Deployment
  - [ ] 5.1 Write tests for Docker build and container startup
  - [ ] 5.2 Create multi-stage Dockerfile (build + runtime, <500MB final image)
  - [ ] 5.3 Update docker-compose.yml with health checks and proper volume management
  - [ ] 5.4 Add environment variable validation in entrypoint script
  - [ ] 5.5 Create Docker secrets support for sensitive credentials
  - [ ] 5.6 Add container health check script
  - [ ] 5.7 Test Docker deployment end-to-end (build, run, health check)
  - [ ] 5.8 Verify Docker deployment meets all requirements

- [ ] 6. Create Installation & Deployment Documentation
  - [ ] 6.1 Write INSTALLATION.md (local setup for macOS/Linux)
  - [ ] 6.2 Write DEPLOYMENT.md (Docker, VPS, cloud deployment guides)
  - [ ] 6.3 Create setup.sh automated installation script
  - [ ] 6.4 Document backup/restore procedures
  - [ ] 6.5 Create incident response runbook
  - [ ] 6.6 Write user guide with usage examples
  - [ ] 6.7 Update README.md with production deployment info
  - [ ] 6.8 Verify all documentation is complete and accurate

## Success Criteria

- ✅ All security controls implemented and tested
- ✅ Error handling prevents crashes and provides graceful degradation
- ✅ Test coverage >80% overall (>90% for custom_rag.py)
- ✅ Docker image builds successfully and runs with health checks
- ✅ Complete documentation for installation, deployment, and operations
- ✅ All acceptance criteria from SPECIFICATIONS.md met

## Notes

- Follow TDD approach: write tests first, then implement
- Each major task should be completed and tested before moving to next
- Security is priority #1 - no shortcuts on security controls
- All changes should be committed to git with clear commit messages
- Production deployment should be tested in staging environment first
