# Product Mission (Lite)

RAG Builder is a knowledge base optimization tool that helps AI developers and teams prepare documentation for GPT Assistants by converting PDFs and web content into optimized markdown files that maximize the 40M token limit (20 files Ã— 2M tokens per file).

RAG Builder serves AI developers and documentation teams who need to prepare large knowledge bases for GPT Assistants efficiently. Unlike traditional PDF converters, RAG Builder uses OpenAI's own models to intelligently consolidate content into 20 optimized markdown files with real-time token counting, fitting 2-3x more usable information within the 2M token-per-file constraint while ensuring superior tokenization quality for RAG retrieval.
