# Upload Your RAG Buckets to a Custom GPT

## What You Have Ready

✅ **2 semantic bucket files** in `/output` directory:
- `bucket_01_frontend_ui.md` - 430K tokens (17 docs)
- `bucket_02_security_auth.md` - 238K tokens (2 docs)

Total: **668K tokens** (well under the 2M per file limit)

## How to Create a Custom GPT with These Files

### Step 1: Go to Custom GPT Builder
Visit: https://chatgpt.com/gpts/editor

### Step 2: Configure Your GPT

**Name:** Choose a name (e.g., "My Knowledge Base Assistant")

**Description:**
```
A specialized assistant with access to comprehensive documentation covering frontend UI development and security/authentication topics.
```

**Instructions:**
```
You are a knowledgeable assistant with expertise in:
- Frontend & UI Development (React, components, interfaces, CSS)
- Security & Authentication (OAuth, permissions, tokens, security best practices)

When answering questions:
1. Always reference the specific document or section you're citing
2. Provide code examples when relevant
3. Explain concepts clearly with context
4. If information isn't in your knowledge base, say so clearly
```

**Conversation starters:**
```
- How do I implement authentication in my app?
- Show me best practices for React components
- What security measures should I implement?
- Explain OAuth token management
```

### Step 3: Upload Knowledge Files

1. Scroll to **Knowledge** section
2. Click **Upload files**
3. Upload both bucket files:
   - `output/bucket_01_frontend_ui.md`
   - `output/bucket_02_security_auth.md`

### Step 4: Configure Settings

**Capabilities:**
- ✅ Web Browsing (optional)
- ✅ DALL-E Image Generation (optional)
- ✅ Code Interpreter (recommended for code examples)

**Additional Settings:**
- Keep conversation starters visible
- Enable file search (automatically enabled when you upload knowledge)

### Step 5: Save & Test

1. Click **Create** in top-right
2. Choose **Only me** or **Anyone with a link** or **Public**
3. Test with a question like: "What security best practices are covered in the documentation?"

## Notes

- **Token Limits:** Each file can hold up to 2M tokens. Your files are at ~21% and ~12% capacity respectively
- **File Count:** Custom GPTs support up to 20 files
- **Updates:** You can replace files anytime by deleting and re-uploading
- **Sharing:** You can share your Custom GPT with others via link or make it public

## Next Steps to Improve

1. **Add More Content:** Your buckets have room for ~5x more content each
2. **Better Categorization:** With GPT-4 API, create more granular topic buckets
3. **Optimization:** Clean up formatting and remove redundancy
4. **More Sources:** Add website content, not just PDFs
